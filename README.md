# AUDIO VIDEO APP

## Project Description:

You will be building an audio / video app in the Authoring class, using queries and database assets that you’ll be compiling the the Advanced Web class. Create assets based on the Roku Flashback brief (to be supplied) to create the views and templates you will be working with. The first part of the project (fall term) will focus on creating the correct app structure with some tooling in place (Gulp, SASS etc). You will be exploring Vue.js as a frontend framework to help build the project. You’ll continue to develop the app with various features in the winter term. A user should be able to log in, filter and select a movie, tv show or audio based on user profile (adult or kids). You will build an API that will let a user comment on the selection, rate it, and share via social media. 

## Project Requirements:

## Part 1 - 
Fall Term: Designer Design the look and feel of a mobile-first web application based on the supplied brief (Roku Flashback). Creatively this project is wide open - push yourself to explore the latest trends in mobile-first design. Consider the end user; focus on engaging UX and UI. 

## Part 1 -
Fall Term: Developer Create the correct folder structure based on best practices as explored in class. Use a combination of tools to create production-ready “shell” files from feature-based modules. Use those same tools to create stubbed (shell) minified assets (JavaScript, SCSS/CSS etc) for production. 


## Detailed Requirements:
1. Create a folder structure for the application (refer to class examples). 
2. Use NPM to add and save dependencies / modules; create a functional Gulp file. 
3. Use Gulp to compile and minify your production files (SCSS -> CSS, minified JS file, other Grunt-based tooling like image optimization etc) 
4. Create a repo and push your development branch to it. Your should have a master branch and potentially a couple of feature branches (login, A/V controls etc).
